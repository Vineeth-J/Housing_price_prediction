# Housing_price_prediction
* This data science project is a housing price prediction website.
* Built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. 
* Implemented a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
* Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc 
* and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
* During this project used all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 
  Technology and tools wise this project covers,

    - Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
    - Matplotlib for data visualization
    - Sklearn for model building
    - Python flask for http server
    - HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
